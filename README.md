  <h1><b>What is this?</b></h1>
  <p>
    This is a project on the Laplace Transform I made for an upcoming exhibition happening at my school(it's happening around February 2026). This project uses Python as the main programming language due to it's
    insane readability and the vast amount of libraries. Mainly, I'll be using Matplotlib, SymPy, NumPy, and some other math-related libraries. I've had experience with graphing math functions and transforms in
    Python before, as last year(and this is available in my GitHub too) I made a Fourier Transform plotter in Python. The project description is basically all provided in the PDF file "Overview", so feel free to
    check it out. Also, documentation is provided in the code itself to make it as readable as possible.
